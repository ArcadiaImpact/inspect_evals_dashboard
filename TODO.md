# TODO

* Complete project.toml
* Complete streamlit configs
* Add unit tests (checkout how to test Streamlit apps)
* Create staging and prod environments in Streamlit
* Hardcode the default scorer to use (so we don't need to rely on the first scorer)
* Double check requirements.txt
  * Use a hash for inspect_evals_scoring once branch is merged
* Create README about how to run locally and how to deploy
* Set up Github actions to run tests automatically
