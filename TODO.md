# TODO

* Template coding page and import structure to all pages
* Add config for dev, staging, prod
* Complete project.toml
* Complete streamlit configs
* Add unit tests (checkout how to test Streamlit apps)
* Create staging and prod environments in Streamlit
* Configure AWS secret to fetch logs from S3
* Add caching of eval logs from S3
* At the top of each evaluation page, hard code the list of evals to display
  * Hardcode the default scorer to use (so we don't need to rely on the first scorer)
* Double check requirements.txt
  * Use a hash for inspect_evals_scoring once branch is merged
* Create README about how to run locally and how to deploy
* Set up Github actions to run tests automatically
